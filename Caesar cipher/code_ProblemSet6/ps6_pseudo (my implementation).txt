Problem 2: findBestShifts
=========================

1. initialize an empty dictionary where key=shift and value=maximum number of real English words using the corresponding shift in the key on the ciphertext

2. for shift in range(0,26)
    3. decipher the text with shift
    4. check how many of the words in the decrypted text are present in the wordList
    5. record the shift and the number of English words found in the dictionary
    
6. check for the shift key that corresponds to the maximum number of English words in 	the dictionary and return it
